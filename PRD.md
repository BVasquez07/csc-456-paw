# Project Paw 

## ðŸ‘€ Problem

Pet owners often face challenges in finding reliable and suitable pet sitters when they need to be away. This process can be time-consuming and stressful, with limited options and uncertainties about the quality of care. Existing solutions lack a user-friendly and efficient platform to connect pet owners with trustworthy pet sitters.

## ðŸ’­ Proposal

To address this issue, we propose the development of Paw, an application that functions similarly to Tinder, allowing pet owners to match with potential pet sitters based on various criteria. The app will prioritize user-friendly design and efficient matching algorithms.

## ðŸ›« Plan
- What are we building? 
  - A web application connecting pet owners with potential pet sitters based on preferences.
- How does it work? 
  - Users create profiles, set preferences, and match with suitable pet sitters.
- How do we know that it works? 
  - Successful matches, positive user feedback, and improved user satisfaction.
- What are we measuring? 
  - User engagement, successful matches, and overall user satisfaction.
- When will it be ready?
  - Development is estimated to be completed by May, 2024.
